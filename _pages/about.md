Hi I'm Sukwon Yun! ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a Master's degree candidate for Industrial & Systems Engineering at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology),
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best teammates at [DSAIL@KAIST](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research interest lies primarily in **Graph Neural Networks in *<span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>real-world scenarios</span>* and their fundamental *<span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>weakness</span>***.

- <span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>**Long-Tailedness**</span> (Everything, literally *everything* is long-tailed!)
- <span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>**Missing Features**</span> (In real-world, only partial features are available!)
- <span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>**Heterophily**</span> (Real-world graphs are not always homophilous!)
- <span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>**Oversmoothing**</span> (Is 2 or 3 layers enough?)
