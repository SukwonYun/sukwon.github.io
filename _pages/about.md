I am a master's student in the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL)](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

During my master's year, I had a memorable experience in Tokyo as a visiting researcher at the [Murata Lab](http://www.net.c.titech.ac.jp/index.html) in [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english), under the guidance of [Prof. Tsoyoshi Murata](http://www.net.c.titech.ac.jp/murata.html). I also had the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Dr. Xin Liu](https://staff.aist.go.jp/xin.liu/).

In a nutshell, my research interest lies primarily in **Graph Neural Networks** with their **real-world applications**. I am interested in <u>mitigating the inductive bias of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</u> in real-world scenarios, with their <u>application in the field of Computational Biology</u>, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing. Keywords include but are not limited to the following:

- Long-Tail Problem on Graphs
- Missing Features on Graphs
- Heterophily on Graphs
- Data Sparsity (Dropout) on scRNA-seq data

- <span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>**Heterophily**</span> (Real-world graphs are not always homophilous!)
- <span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>**Oversmoothing**</span> (Is 2 or 3 layers enough?) -->
