Hi I'm Sukwon Yun! ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a Master's degree candidate for Industrial & Systems Engineering at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology),
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best teammates at [DSAIL@KAIST](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research interest lies primarily in ***Weakness* of Graph Neural Networks**.

- ``Long-Tailedness`` (Everything, literally *everything* is long-tailed!)
- ``Oversmoothing`` (Is 2 or 3 layers enough?)
- ``Heterophily`` (Real-world graphs are not always homophilous!)
- ``Missing Features`` (In real-world, only partial features are available!)
