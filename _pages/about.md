I am a researcher at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL)](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), where I was advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/) during my Master's. Currently, I am also closely working with [Dr. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/) at CSAIL@MIT.

During my Master's year, I had a memorable experience in Tokyo as a visiting researcher at the [Murata Lab](http://www.net.c.titech.ac.jp/index.html) in [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english), under the guidance of [Prof. Tsoyoshi Murata](http://www.net.c.titech.ac.jp/murata.html), and actively collaborated with with [Dr. Xin Liu](https://staff.aist.go.jp/xin.liu/).

In a nutshell, my primary research interest falls under the keyword **<u>AI4Science</u>**: **Graph Neural Networks** with their **applications in biomedical domain**. I am interested in <u>addressing the inductive bias of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</u> with their <u>application in the field of Medical and Computational Biology</u>, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing and Tumor Biology. Keywords include but are not limited to the following:

- Long-Tail Problem on Graphs
- Missing Features on Graphs
- Heterophily on Graphs
- Data Sparsity (Dropout) on scRNA-seq data
- Tissue Phenotype

<!-- 
My research interest lies primarily in ***Graph Neural Networks* in <span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>real-world scenarios</span> and their fundamental <span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>weakness</span>**. -->

<!-- - <span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>**Long-Tailedness**</span> (Everything, literally *everything* is long-tailed!)
- <span style='background-color:#fff5b1'>**Missing Features**</span> (In real-world, only partial features are available!)
- <span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>**Heterophily**</span> (Real-world graphs are not always homophilous!)
- <span style='background-color:#F7DDBE'>**Oversmoothing**</span> (Is 2 or 3 layers enough?) -->
